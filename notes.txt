What I did to fix it.

1. Used the code from viewerexample.html
2. Added in any missing files and made sure they were pointing to the correct location in the html 
3. There was a problem when loading an image, it wouldn't run. Error was something like "uncaught in promise". Was saying there was an error in the the bisweb.js file. 
4. To fix this, uninstalled biswebbrowser, uninstalled Jquery, uninstall Three.js. Reininstalled everything, added Jqueury 3.3.1, biswebbrowser "latest", and three 0.100.0. It worked after that. I think the problem was a wrong version of Three.js or Jquery.

To run, in console type 'gulp webserver'
